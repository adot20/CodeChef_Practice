# Chess Ratings
# Alice has recently started playing Chess. Her current rating is X. She noticed that when she wins a game, her rating increases by 8 points.
# Can you help Alice in finding out the minimum number of games she needs to win in order to make her rating greater than or equal to Y?

# Input Format:
# The first line of input will contain an integer T â€” the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
# The first line of each test case contains two integers X and Y, as described in the problem statement.

# Output Format:
# For each test case, output the minimum number of games that Alice needs to win in order to make her rating greater than or equal to Y.

test_case = int(input())
for _ in range(test_case):
    current_rank, rank_to_aim = map(int, input().split())
    rank_difference = rank_to_aim - current_rank
    if rank_difference % 8 == 0:
        min_game = rank_difference // 8
    else:
        min_game = (rank_difference // 8) + 1
    print(min_game)
