# Alice and Bob are playing a game. Each player rolls a regular six faced dice 3 times.
# The score of a player is the sum of the values of the highest 2 rolls. The player with the highest score wins, and the game ends in a Tie if both players have the same score.

# Input Format:
# The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
# Each test case contains six space-separated integers A1, A2, A3, B1, B2 and B3 â€” the values Alice gets in her 3 dice rolls, followed by the values which Bob gets in his 3 dice rolls.

# Output Format:
# For each test case, output on a new line Alice if Alice wins, Bob if Bob wins and Tie in case of a tie.
